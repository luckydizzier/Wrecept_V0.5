# M3.1 Task Bundle – Persistence, Filters & Settings

## Context
The application now has basic navigation and in-memory data. To proceed toward a usable release it needs SQLite persistence, flexible filtering, master-data maintenance and user-customisable settings.

## Objectives
- Store invoices, suppliers and products in a local SQLite database under `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Wrecept/wrecept.db`.
- Provide date, supplier, product group and product filters from the **Listák** menu.
- Allow CRUD operations on suppliers and products through dedicated windows.
- Offer a settings dialog with light/dark theme toggle saved to `settings.json`.
- Ensure full unit and integration test coverage using in-memory SQLite.
- Update documentation and screenshots to reflect the new features.

## Constraints
- All dialogs must be keyboard navigable with accelerators and `Esc` to close.
- Seed demo data when tables are empty.
- Persist user theme between sessions.
- Tests must not depend on external files.

## Agent Tasks
1. **infra_agent** – Implement `SqliteConnectionFactory` and repository classes (`Invoice`, `Supplier`, `Product`). Register them in `AppContext` and add seeding logic.
2. **viewmodel_agent** – Inject SQLite repositories. Create filter dialog view models and master-data view models. Add `SettingsViewModel` with JSON load/save.
3. **ui_agent** – Implement XAML dialogs for filters, master-data windows and settings window. Wire menu entries and keyboard shortcuts.
4. **ux_agent** – Define focus order and accelerators. Add status-bar hints for filter and CRUD actions.
5. **test_agent** – Unit tests for repositories and filter logic using in-memory SQLite. Verify settings JSON round-trip.
6. **docs_agent** – Update README and user manual with new shortcuts, DB path and screenshot `docs/img/invoice_view_dark.png`. Extend `ui_flow.md` with dialog flows.

## Deliverables
- Database schema SQL and migrator logic in place.
- Application runs with seeded demo data and persists modifications.
- Filtering and CRUD dialogs operational from the keyboard.
- Theme selection persists via `settings.json`.
- Updated docs and tests demonstrating the above.
